# Maths_Calculator 

In this website i created a maths calculator which performs all operations on numbers.
What is the implementation?
  1) It takes the input string contatining operands and operators of Infix Expression format.
  2) It will convert Infix expression into Prefix expression (because we can perform calculations more easier on prefix than on infix)
  3) Finally it evaluates the Postfix expressions and displays it.
 Languages used:- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
